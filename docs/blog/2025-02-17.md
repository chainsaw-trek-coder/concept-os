# Recap

I'm surprised I've made it this many days in a row of actual work. My memory allocator appears to function so that's a win.
My next step will be to refactor my code so that it can be used more generically.
Afterwards I plan on starting the difficult process of loading my kernel into memory and attempting to jump to it.

# And now...

I've managed to copy my memory allocation code and tests into the kernel common library. Things are working. I am going to bed lol.
