Tonight was somewhat eventful. I managed to move my memory logic into kernel-common. The tricky part was getting CMake to link the library into my other projects.

I'd imagine my CMake setup is really ugly right now but at least I have code sharing now.

The next step is to load the kernel into memory and jump to it.
