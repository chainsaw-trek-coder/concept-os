## Recap

It looks like I'm on a little bit of a roll as far as working consistently on this.

In my spare time I've been thinking about how my kernel will load into memory.
Potentially the kernel can be loaded into lower physical memory and then remapped into high virtual memory.
If there is anything in that memory, the those physical addresses will take the place of where the kernel is physically.

It would be interesting if I can architect my OS to support in-place kernel upgrades. The idea would be to load an updated kernel 
and swap it in to handle interrupts and system calls.

I think this feature would make my kernel special.

In the mean time I will try to make progress by writing tests for my new memory allocator updates.
