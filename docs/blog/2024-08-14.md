## Recap

Yay mee... So I paused on this project for quite a while and forgot to commit my changes it seems.

Last that I remember is that I finished my ELF parser and was ready to load my kernel into a new location.

This will be a set back as I get back into the swing of things

At the very least I got my Codespace back. It takes about 30 to 45 minutes to build.
